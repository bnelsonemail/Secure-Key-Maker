# 🔐 Secure Key Maker

**Generate secure, customizable keys instantly — right in your browser.**

[🔗 Live Demo](https://bnelsonemail.github.io/Secure-Key-Maker/)

---

## 🧭 Overview

**Secure Key Maker** is a lightweight JavaScript app that creates randomized keys and passwords based on your preferences — all client-side, no data stored or sent anywhere.  

Choose your combination:
- ✅ Lowercase letters  
- ✅ Uppercase letters  
- ✅ Numbers  
- ✅ Symbols  

Then set your desired length and let the generator do its magic.

## ⚙️ Features

- Built in **pure JavaScript** — no libraries, no dependencies.  
- Clean and responsive UI (ideal for quick use or embedding in other projects).  
- Simple, secure randomization logic using the browser’s native `Math.random()` (upgrade-ready to `crypto.getRandomValues()` if desired).  
- Works entirely offline — perfect for local or private use.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open the [demo page](https://bnelsonemail.github.io/Secure-Key-Maker/).  
2. Choose your character sets (letters, numbers, symbols).  
3. Set the desired key length.  
4. Click **Generate** — your secure key appears instantly.  
5. Copy and use it anywhere you need a strong password or API key.

## 🧩 Example Output

- t9F#r8@ZkP$2
- B2!x4Qy1%aL7


Each key is unique, randomized, and based on your chosen character criteria.

## 🧠 Behind the Scenes

This project started as a **JavaScript fundamentals exercise** — focusing on:
- DOM manipulation  
- Event listeners  
- String operations  
- Basic input validation  

It’s since become a neat little utility that still holds up well for quick secure key generation.

## 💡 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add `crypto.getRandomValues()` for cryptographically stronger randomness  
- [ ] Include a “copy to clipboard” button (if not already present)  
- [ ] Allow for exclusion of similar characters (e.g., `O`, `0`, `l`, `1`)  
- [ ] Option to download multiple keys at once
